This is the Administrative Platform handling all database activity.

Users are capable of adding clients and editing their information. They are also able to add stock media in order to later link this to clients as needed. Once client information is entered it becomes callable via an API call. All front end sites (to be built in BackboneJS) will call all necessary information through this API, filtered by unique API key attached to each client.

Website makes use of Bootstrap and is built on the MEAN stack.
